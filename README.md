# OrderedArrayList

### Important notes
-Remember that you still have access to parent class methods when overriding them.

-There are many methods in the ArrayList that can break the NoNullArrayList and OrderedArrayList. We will ignore this because I don't want you overriding a bunch of methods to fix that.

-DO NOT use any built in sort methods except for testing purposes (Sort commands should ONLY exist in your tester program, not the classes you are writing)

You may access parent class methods using super.
